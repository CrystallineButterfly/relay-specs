  operationId: "submitBlock"
  summary: Submit a new block to the relay.
  description: |
    * Blocks can be submitted as plain JSON or be gzip encoded.
    
    * The relay will simulate the block to verify properties and proposer
      payment in the payment transaction from builder to proposer
      `fee_recipient` at the end of block.
    
    * For accountability, builder signature is over the SSZ encoded `message`.
    
    * The `message`, which does not include the transactions, will be made
      public via the data API, allowing anyone to verify the builder signature.
    
    * Any new submission by a builder will overwrite a previous one by the same
      `builder_pubkey`, even if it is less profitable.
